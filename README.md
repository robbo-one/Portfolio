## About me:

I am a developer with a passion for creating software that pushes the boundaries of tech, our lives and the environment around us. I have a deep interest in developing products and services that contribute to a healthier more fulfilling way of life. I'm passionate about software that can solve real-world problems and has a strong focus on the potential impact on people and the environment.

I was on a journey to complete my commercial pilotâ€™s license. A global pandemic and lack of creative aspects to the job itself steered me towards software development and I'm so glad it did. I love this new world that I've dived into and hope to absorb and learn as much as possible. It excites me to know at our fingertips, software has the power to improve our lives with infinite possibilities. The challenges motivate me and fuel my insatiable hunger for knowledge.

I am seeking a forward thinking organization that will help launch my career in tech. I've gained a diverse range of skills through a variety of work environments. In addition, I have the ability to both lead and be a part of a team. I love to encourage and inspire those around me and see my peers strive and succeed just as much as reaching my own goals.

During my studies at Enspiral Dev Academy we focused on the code and software full stack, primarily focusing on full stack web applications using Javascript. As well as making use of various module's, dependencies, React redux, api's, data bases and more. A huge part of the course also focused on human and soft skills and agile software development. We carried out a lot of pair programming and working in teams to deliver projects within very short time constraints building on our knowledge and skill levels day by day.
