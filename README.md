## About me:

I am a driven Software Developer and graduate of Enspiral Dev Academy with a passion for creating products and services that improve our lives and the environment around us. I have a deep interest in working for causes that contribute to a healthier more fulfilling way of life. I'm passionate about software that can solve real-world problems!

I was on a journey to complete my commercial pilotâ€™s license. A global pandemic and lack of creative aspects to the job itself steered me towards software development and I'm so glad it did. I love this new world that I've dived into and hope to absorb and learn as much as possible. It excites me to know at our fingertips, software has the power to improve our lives with infinite possibilities. The challenges motivate me and fuel my insatiable hunger for knowledge.

I am seeking to launch my career in tech with a forward thinking company that will support me through the launch of my career and allow me to grow with them. I've gained a diverse range of skills through a variety of work environments. In addition, I have the ability to both lead and be a part of a team. I love to encourage and inspire those around me and see my peers strive and succeed just as much as reaching my own goals.

During my studies at Enspiral Dev Academy we focused on the code and software full stack, primarily focusing on full stack web applications using Javascript. As well as making use of various module's, dependencies, React redux, api's, data bases and more. A huge part of the course focuses on human and soft skills, EQ and agile software development. We carried out a lot of pair programming and worked in teams to deliver projects within very short time constraints constantly building on our knowledge and skill levels day by day.
